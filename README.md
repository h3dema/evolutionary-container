# This repository

I made this repository to create a special container with lots of python tools to develop programs with Evolutionary Algorithms, specially Genetic Algorithms.

# Genetic Algorithms #

This container has two Genetic Algorithms packages -- pyevolve and Deep.

## pyevolve ##

If you want more information about Pyevolve, go to [the documentation on pyevolve site](http://pyevolve.sourceforge.net/).

## Deep ##

DEAP is an evolutionary computation framework for rapid prototyping and testing.
It seeks to make algorithms explicit and data structures transparent. It works in perfect harmony with parallelization mechanism such as multiprocessing and SCOOP.

# More about GA #

There is a lot of good material on the internet.

* [Introduction to Genetic Algorithms](http://www.obitko.com/tutorials/genetic-algorithms/index.php) -- provides an introduction of GA by Marek Obitko.

* [A Field Guide to Genetic Programming](http://www.gp-field-guide.org.uk/p) -- An e-book, freely downloadable under a Creative Commons license. Written in 2008.

* [A Genetic Algorithm Tutorial](http://samizdat.mines.edu/ga_tutorial/ga_tutorial.ps) by Darrell Whitley Computer Science Department Colorado State University
