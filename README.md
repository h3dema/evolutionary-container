# This repository

I made this repository to create a special container with lots of python tools to develop programs with Evolutionary Algorithms, specially Genetic Algorithms.

## Install and run ##

```bash
$ docker build -t ga github.com/h3dema/evolutionary-container.git
$ docker run -u ga -it ga
```

# Genetic Algorithms #

This container has two Genetic Algorithms packages -- pyevolve and Deep.

## pyevolve ##

If you want more information about Pyevolve, go to [the documentation on pyevolve site](http://pyevolve.sourceforge.net/).

## Deap ##

DEAP is an evolutionary computation framework for rapid prototyping and testing.
It seeks to make algorithms explicit and data structures transparent. It works in perfect harmony with parallelization mechanism such as multiprocessing and SCOOP.

See more on [deap site](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/deap).
